#Instructions:
This scripts needs two arguments, the queue directory, 
i.e. the source directory and the watch directorty.

Also you'll have to add the following line to the .rtorrent.rc:

	system.method.set_key=event.download.finished,move_complete,"execute=~/enqueue_rtorrent.sh,~/queue,~/torrents"

Where ~/queue and ~/torrents are their arguments

With this setup, every time a torrent download is finished, another one will
be loaded from the queue directory
